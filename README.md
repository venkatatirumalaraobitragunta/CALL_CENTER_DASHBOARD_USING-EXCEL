🧩 **Core Concept**

The core idea behind the project is that every customer call contains valuable information about service quality and business performance. Instead of viewing the data in a raw spreadsheet, Excel is used to structure the information and create an interactive dashboard, making it easier to observe patterns, compare performance, and support decision-making.

 🧹 **2. Data Cleaning & Preparation**

Before creating the dashboard, the data was prepared in Excel by:

* Removing blank and duplicate rows
* Renaming and formatting column headers
* Converting dates and numbers into proper data types
* Creating structured tables for easy analysis

✅ This ensured accuracy and consistency throughout the dashboard.

📊 **3. Dashboard & Visual Insights**

Excel PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Slicers were used to display:

* Total number of calls
* Average call duration
* Customer satisfaction trends
